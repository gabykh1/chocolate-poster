# Creating forms of colored cows on a poster of chocolate

My code creates the shapes of cows on a poster by connecting given 
coordinates using PIL library and paint them.
The code contains explanatory lines to make it easier to understand
the library and how to use it





## chocolate cow
The outcome:

## Installation

For that project you'll need to install PIL package:

```bash
go to the Command Prompt and type "pip install pillow"
be aware to install it also in your IDE (I used PyCharm)
```
